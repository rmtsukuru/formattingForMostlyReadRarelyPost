# formattingForMostlyReadRarelyPost

/u/MostlyReadRarelyPost, a Reddit user, has been telling [a pretty cool story](https://www.reddit.com/r/MostlyWrites/comments/6ihbhi/steelshod_table_of_contents_resources/) about a campaign that he created with two of his friends.

He's been sharing the stories on [/r/DnDGreentext](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDGreentext/). To do so, however, he's needed to format his stories in a special way:

1. New lines will have `>` appended to the front of them
2. New paragraphs will be separated by line breaks (with no indents)
3. There's a header and a footer to each story. These will be appended above and below the story, and separated with a "horizontal rule" (`*****`).

This simple web app is designed to help him accomplish this more easily, *as well as* giving him the power to port his writings over to his new subreddit, [/r/MostlyWrites](https://www.reddit.com/r/MostlyWrites/).
